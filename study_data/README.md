## Recreating the Mutations
For the study, we performed three types of mutation: changing the color of a car, adding a car, and adding a pedestrian. 
The mutations were carried out in batches of 6000 with 2000 each of the different mutations.
The `all_mutation_logs` folder contains 25 files, each with 6000 mutation parameters that describe each of the mutations produced.
Together, these 25 files provide the full parameters needed to generate the 150,000 mutations from the study.
